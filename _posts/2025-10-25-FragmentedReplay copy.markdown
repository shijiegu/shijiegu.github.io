### Concept of interest: Sharp Wave Ripples
In this [post](https://shijiegu.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/07/19/ripple.html), we see that from a structural point of view, the hippocampus is a prominent structure. When we look at the activity of the hippocampus in time, the most prominent window is during so called Sharp Wave Ripples, which is when many neurons fire together, achieving a temporarily high co-activity. These events mostly happen when the animal is in a stationary state, such as sleeping, eating, or grooming. Although transient, 50 ms to 300 ms each and altogether less than 2% of time is devoted to those high firing moments, those bursts are essential for learning as [removing some of these events are sufficient](https://rnel.rice.edu/pubs/Jadhav%20et%20al_2012_Awake%20Hippocampal%20Sharp-Wave%20Ripples%20Support%20Spatial%20Memory.pdf) to induce learning deficit in rats and [making these events longer]((https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax0758)) helps rats learn faster.

Since these Sharp Wave Ripples (SWR) are so magical, the field has been trying to understand how these neuronal co-firing helps learning. One clue comes from the fact that during <em>some</em> of the SWRs, the order in which neurons fire recapitulate the same order in which they fire during running. Since neurons in the hippocampus tend to fire a particular locations during running, we can read the neuronal firing order to find which spatial trajectory the neurons likely represent or <em>replay</em>.

However, not all SWR events come with these clear trajectories. In fact, SWR events with more neuronal firing tend to be those without clear trajectories. However, these SWRs are largely untouched by the field. My main PhD project is on deciphering these events.

  <figcaption>SWRs that do not contain smooth spatial trajectories tend to have robust firing of neurons. Magenta denotes where the rat is and the little line on top shows its head direction. The blue/green/yellow shades show the estimate of the animal location from its hippocampus signal, with brighter color denoting regions of higher confidence of the inference. </figcaption>
