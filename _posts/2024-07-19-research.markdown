The brain carries out many different tasks; there are countless number of cells (neurons and neuron maintainence cells), cell types in various brain regions. However, if you take a cross section of the brain and stain them to locate cells; you'd see a couple dense strips. These dense strips of cells lie in the brain region hippocampus. Not only do hippocampus have a striking dense collection of cells, the region is central to memory, navigation, and relational thinking. I study the main output part of the hippocampus.

The cover picture shows what the activities in the CA1 region of the hippocampus look like when a lot of cells fire around the same time --- talking about 10s of ms. These strong deflections are thought to be the key driver for memory consolidation.

How far are we to understand this? We know a lot and very little at the same time. Stay tuned.
