This is my first post for documenting Duboce Park.

You know on sidewalks, sometimes tree roots outgrow the constraint of the concrete? On my way home, after I get off the bike, walking on the sidewalk, I almost tripped over one. Maybe because it was awkward I was tripped over by a tree, and maybe I didn't want others walking by to be tripped over, I whispered "be careful there" in a low, airway voice. The girl of couple walking past me with their dog nevertheless replied, "it sucks" in an equally low, airway voice.
