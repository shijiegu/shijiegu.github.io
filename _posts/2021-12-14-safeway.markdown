This story is about the Safeway near Duboce Park.

I don't know if you've seen cracked eggs making a mess in a supermarket. I've seen a lot at this Safeway, and every time I thought, why could someone be so careless. Never had I thought I would be doing that once today. I went in, got two dozens of eggs, went to the cashier. (Since it is not a busy time, otherwise I would do self-check out.)

As I am putting a handful of things off to cashier, my top dozen of eggs fell off my hand. And then literally, a very loud crack. Why it fell off is still beyond me...

What is more beyond me is that I look up and I ended up at a cashier that is...exceptionally handsome. He is so strong, so big, handsome and most importantly so gentle. I have never met such a handsome cashier in my life, like ever. He told me to get another box of eggs.

I wanted to spend more time at that checkout lane.
