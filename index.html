<h2>Remember the sparkles?</h2>

<p>Remember the sparkles?</p>
<p>that shine on your freckles...</p>
<p>What were you looking at, up far into the light?</p>
<p>You decided...</p> 
<p>but you just simply hoped.</p>
 <br>
<p>that you don't wanna force your head to raise,</p>
<p>that you don't wanna stretch your neck to see,</p>
<p>while repeating that logistics, working out the looks,</p>
<p>the reticent kindness, the unctuous "impressionists", or the rare genuine.</p>
 <br>
<p>You decided again this year,</p>
<p>well, not as wistful as last year,</p>
<p>simply to sleep tight.</p>
<p>But, he also remembered...</p>
 <br>
<p>that people forget about the nice things near them, </p>
<p>that the best people in front of them, </p>
<p>also that he hasn't hacked rooftops,</p>
<p>and that he is at a quite nice building that is tall.</p>
<p>Well, not the tallest.</p>
<p>but again, he remembered.</p>
 <br>
<p>The swipe, the usual atrium,</p>
<p>where he's been around for more than a year.</p>
<p>splendid with wizard's breeze, oddly relaxing.</p>
<p>They walked through, climbed up, pushed against.</p>
 <br>
<p>That summer humid air,</p>
<p>unfocused the streetlights, settled the traffic underneath.</p>
<p>...the sparkles!</p>
<p>that shine in the twinkles...</p>
<p>What are you looking at, straight ahead into the light?</p>
 <br>
<p>The he among the friends of crowd or the crowd of friends,</p>
<p>and the me here on the rooftop in wind.</p>

<h2>River, River</h2>

<p>I'm feeling 22 in the sun of Boston.</p>
<p>A to-be-scientist actively rowing into the wind, </p>
<p>A to-be-singer-songwriter in mind. </p>
<p>The wind, now breeze, </p>
<p>comes with the memory of the freeze.</p>
<p>The bridges we cross, now in sun, in red green cloudy graffiti,</p>
<p>come with the memory,</p>
<p>of me and others under the yellow street light, </p>
<p>as well as alone in darkness.</p>
 
<p>They slip by. They slide away.</p>
<p>Far into the blue sky,</p>
<p>Gone with the traffic sound.</p>
 <br> 
<p>Instead,</p>
<p>In waves,</p>
<p>of motions of legs stamping, arms stretching, </p>
<p>and back hinging back and forth.</p>
<p>The babbling of the water,</p>
<p>the river,</p>
<p>streaming in the crack of my heart.</p>
<p>I'm gliding.</p>
<p>With other rowers on the boat.</p>
<p>but with my own oar I row.</p>
