<h1>June 18-19th</h1>
<p>Shijie Gu. </p>
<p>I'm feeling 22 in the sun of Boston.</p>
<p>A to-be-scientist actively rowing into the wind. </p>
<p>The wind, now breeze, comes with the memory of the freeze.</p>
<p>The bridges we cross, now in sun, in red green cloudy graffiti,</p>
<p>come with the memory,</p>
<p>Of me and others under the yellow street light, </p>
<p>as well as alone in darkness.</p>

<p>They slip by. They slide away.</p>
<p>Far into the blue sky,</p>
<p>Gone are the traffic sound,</p>
<p>In waves of motion of leg, arm and back,</p>
<p>The giggling of the water,</p>
<p>streaming in the crack of my heart,</p>
<p>With other rowers on the boat.</p>
<p>But with my own oar I row.</p>
