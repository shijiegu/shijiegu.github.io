<h2>River, River</h2>
<p>Shijie Gu </p>
<p>     June19th,2018 </p>
<p>I'm feeling 22 in the sun of Boston.</p>
<p>A to-be-scientist actively rowing into the wind, </p>
<p>A to-be-singer-songwriter in mind. </p>
<p>The wind, now breeze, </p>
<p>comes with the memory of the freeze.</p>
<p>The bridges we cross, now in sun, in red green cloudy graffiti,</p>
<p>come with the memory,</p>
<p>of me and others under the yellow street light, </p>
<p>as well as alone in darkness.</p>
 <br> 
<p>They slip by. They slide away.</p>
<p>Far into the blue sky,</p>
<p>Gone with the traffic sound.</p>
 <br> 
<p>Instead,</p>
<p>In waves,</p>
<p>of motions of legs stamping, arms stretching, </p>
<p>and back hinging back and forth.</p>
<p>The babbling of the water,</p>
<p>the river,</p>
<p>streaming in the crack of my heart.</p>
<p>I'm gliding.</p>
<p>With other rowers on the boat.</p>
<p>but with my own oar I row.</p>
